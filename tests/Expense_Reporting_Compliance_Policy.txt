Created: December 18, 2025, by Jonathan Cubero
Last Updated: December 18, 2025, by Jonathan Cubero
Applies To: All employees

------------------------------------------------------------

COMPLIANCE AGENT RESPONSIBILITIES
The compliance agent must perform the following checks before approving or escalating any expense report:

A. Check Policy Rules, Allowances, and Caps
- Validate all spending against daily, trip, category, and cost center caps.
- Confirm receipt and documentation requirements are met (itemized receipts, proof of payment, attendee lists).
- Ensure exceptions are properly documented and pre-approved when required.

B. Check Approval Logic, Role-Based Spend, and Escalation
- Verify that the correct approver roles are assigned based on submitter’s position and spend level.
- Apply escalation logic for high-value transactions, exceptions, or cost center utilization ≥80%.
- Confirm Finance and Compliance involvement for flagged anomalies or policy deviations.

C. Check Project, Campaign, and Anomalies
- Validate that each expense is linked to an approved project or campaign code.
- Detect anomalies such as duplicate claims, split transactions, or unusual vendor patterns.
- Route suspicious or high-risk items for targeted audit and compliance review.

Agents should log all validation outcomes and escalate unresolved issues per workflow rules.
